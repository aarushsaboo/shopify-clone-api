# Shopify Clone Backend

Welcome to the backend for the Shopify Clone project! This server-side application handles the core logic, database interactions, and API endpoints for the e-commerce platform.

## Overview

The backend provides the following functionalities:

- **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints for product management, user authentication, and order processing.
- **Database Management**: Interactions with a MongoDB database for storing and retrieving data.
- **Integration**: Integration with the frontend and other external services.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the backend server, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL
  
### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   `git clone [repository-url]`

2. Navigate into the project directory:

   `cd [project-directory]`
  
3. Install the dependencies:

   `npm install`

Create a .env file in the root directory and configure your environment variables. You can use .env.example as a reference.

4. Running the Application
   
   `npm start-backend`
   
Use the command above to start the backend server. This will start the server on the port 8000. You can change the port by modifying the environment variables in your .env file.
